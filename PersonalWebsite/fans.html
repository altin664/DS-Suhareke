        <h1>KB Golden Eagle Ylli & Xhebrailat</h1>
        <h3>KB. Golden Eagle Ylli, established in 1975, is one of Kosovo's most storied basketball clubs. Based in Theranda, the team has cultivated a rich history, marked by passionate support from their dedicated fan base known as "Xhebrailat." This fervent group plays a pivotal role in creating an electrifying atmosphere during home games at the 13 Qërshori sports hall, which accommodates approximately 1,300 spectators.

        The synergy between KB Ylli and Xhebrailat is palpable, with fans often orchestrating vibrant displays of support that include coordinated chants, banners, and a sea of team colors. This unwavering enthusiasm not only boosts player morale but also establishes a formidable home-court advantage, making the 13 Qërshori sports hall a challenging venue for visiting teams.
        
        In 2008, financial challenges led to the club's temporary withdrawal from the Kosovo Superleague. However, a resurgence occurred in 2014 when Golden Eagle became the main sponsor, facilitating KB Ylli's return to the league. This partnership heralded a new era of success, culminating in consecutive league titles during the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons.
